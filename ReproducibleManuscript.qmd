What is the scientific method (broadly)?

1. Define a question
2. Gather information and resources (observe)
3. Form an explanatory hypothesis
4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner
5. Analyze the data
6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis
7. <p style="color:red;">Publish results</p>
8. <p style="color:red;">Retest (frequently done by other scientists)</p>

## Problem 
- In 2011, John Ioannidis^[Ioannidis JPA (2005) Why most published
research findings are false. PLoS Med 2(8): e124.]
 published 
![](img/IoannidisPaper.png)
- Why?
  - Studies are underpowered
  - Current incentives lead scientists to publish quantity over quality
  - No incentives for scientists to replicate other studies
  - More...

::: {.notes}
John suggested that the majority of all published papers at the time were likely not true. Or put another way, wouldn't be reproduced
:::
## Problem

Was he right?

- In 2015, the Open Science Collaboration sampled studies from prominent journals to estimate the replicability of psychological research.^[Open Science Collaboration. Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science. Science 349, aac4716 (2015).]

Out of 100 independently performed replications, only 39% were subjectively labelled as successful replications, and on average, the effects were roughly half the original size ^[https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-023-00003-2]

## Problem 

Not just in Psychology: 

- animal behaviour^[Farrar, B. G., Boeckle, M. & Clayton, N. S. Replications in comparative cognition: what should we expect and how can we improve? Anim. Behav. Cognit. 7, 1 (2020).]; 
- cancer biology^[Errington, T. M. et al. Investigating the replicability of preclinical cancer biology. Elife 10, e71601 (2021).]; 
- economics^[Camerer, C. F. et al. Evaluating replicability of laboratory experiments in economics. Science 351, 1433–1436 (2016).]
- pharmaceutical industry^[Begley CG, Ellis LM (2012) Drug development: Raise standards for preclinical cancer research. Nature
483: 531–533. doi: 10.1038/483531a PMID: 22460880]
- neuroscience^[K.S. Button, J.P.A. Ioannidis, C. Mokrysz, B.A. Nosek, J. Flint, E.S.J. Robinson, M.R. Munafò. Power failure: Why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience. Nat Rev Neurosci, 14 (2013), pp. 365-376]
- neuroimaging^[Marek, S., Tervo-Clemmens, B., Calabro, F.J. et al. Reproducible brain-wide association studies require thousands of individuals. Nature 603, 654–660 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04492-9]
- clinical trials^[Carlisle, J. B. Anaesthesia 76, 472–479 (2021).]

::: {.notes}
:::

## Problem

- For clinical trials: 44% contained at least some flawed data:^[Carlisle, J. B. Anaesthesia 76, 472–479 (2021).]
  - impossible statistics, 
  - incorrect calculations, 
  - or duplicated numbers or figures
  - 26% of trials were impossible to judge: either due to incompetence or faked data

## Problem

- Publishing irreproducible results is worse than not publishing: more difficult to eliminate an idea than it is to introduce it^[C. Piller. Disgraced COVID-19 studies are still routinely cited. Science, 371 (2021), pp. 331-332; E.M. Bucci. On zombie papers. Cell Death Dis, 10 (2019), p. 189; S.B. Nissen, T. Magidson, K. Gross, C.T. Bergstrom. Publication bias and the canonization of false facts. eLife, 5 (2016), Article e21451] 

- Spurious results can mislead other researchers who conduct follow-up investigations or try to integrate findings into broader theories.

::: {.notes}
For the clinical trials; for more than 150 trials, the author of the paper got access to anonymized individual participant data (IPD). By studying the IPD spreadsheets, he judged that 44% of these trials contained at least some flawed data: impossible statistics, incorrect calculations or duplicated numbers or figures, for instance. And 26% of the papers had problems that were so widespread that the trial was impossible to trust, he judged — either because the authors were incompetent, or because they had faked the data.

## What Can We Do? 

- Many solutions are needed; far outside the scope of this talk

- **One thing we can do is change the way we write papers.** ![](img/worddoc.png){width=55% height=55%}

- Currently, papers are written and published in a way that results in **errors** and the inability to **computationally reproduce** results.

## What Can We Do?

- **Errors**: a 2016 paper by Nuijten et al.^[Nuijten, Michèle B, Chris HJ Hartgerink, Marcel ALM van Assen, Sacha Epskamp, and Jelte M Wicherts. 2016. “The Prevalence of Statistical Reporting Errors in Psychology (1985–2013).” Behavior Research Methods 48 (4). Springer: 1205–26.] found that 
  - nearly **half** of all papers had errors in them;
  - over **10%** of p-values in published papers were inconsistent with the reported details of the statistical test
  - 1.6% were what they called "grossly" inconsistent, e.g. difference between the p-value and the test statistic meant that one implied statistical significance and the other did not

## What Can We Do?

- **Computational reproducibility**: a 2021 paper by Hardwicke et al.^[T.E. Hardwicke, M. Bohn, K. MacDonald, E. Hembacher, M.B. Nuijten, B.N. Peloquin, et al. Analytic reproducibility in articles receiving open data badges at the journal Psychological Science: An observational study. R Soc Open Sci, 8 (2021), Article 201494] attempted to reproduce results from 25 published papers that publicly shared their data and code:
  - found substantial numerical discrepancies between reported statistical values and values obtained from reproduction attempts in **64%** of these papers

## What Can We Do?

This is where **Reproducible Papers** come in...

# Learning Goals

## Learning Goals

By the end of the talk, the audience should:

- Know what a reproducible manuscript is,
- Understand some reasons why scientists should be writing their manuscripts this way,
- Know what Markdown, Knitr, Pandoc, LaTeX, Jupyter Notebook, R/RMarkdown, and Quarto are,
- Know the basics of the syntax for Markdown, R and Quarto,
- See how to integrate author information, code, equations, tables, images, and citations
- Be able to start writing your next manuscript using Quarto Manuscripts

# Introduction

## What is a reproducible manuscript?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
- Reports the scientific findings
- Provides all (or almost all) the necessary data, code, and methodologies required to create those findings (i.e. data, stats, figures, tables, etc.)
- Transparent and organized
- Enables others to **replicate** and **verify** the results of your study independently

## What are some other benefits?

- Already mentioned:
  - reducing **errors** from copy-pasting results to paper
  - anyone can see how I obtained my results or figures by **reviewing my code** (bonus: learn how others made their figures!)
- Easy to restructure, rewrite, revise:
  - no need to tweak reported values, tables, or figures by hand
  - remove barrier to re-running analyses (thanks to Reviewer #2); speed up resubmission

## What are some other benefits?

- easy cross-referencing and citations
- allow for more rigorous meta-analyses studies to be performed (raw-data)
- can be written in your favorite code editor (RStudio, VSCode, plain text editor, Neovim)
- render from `.qmd` to PDF, Word, HTML, $\LaTeX{}$, etc.
- execute code in R, Python, Julia, and more
- apply journal styles to your outputs with Quarto extensions
- publish to Github Pages, Netlify, and more

# Notebooks: an Aside

## Aside: What is a notebook?

A notebook is a document that contains both **code** and **narrative**:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)

## Aside: What are notebooks good for?

- By combining narrative with code, researchers can share and explain what they did, how they did it, and why they did it.

- Kind of like a research paper but with all the data, stats and computation baked in.

- Great for teaching, communicating, and/or collaborating: where you can directly see what someone did, with helpful explanations along the way.

# Overview of Quarto Manuscript

## Project Files

- `index.qmd`: a notebook file where you write your article. This file contains:
  - document metadata, including article front matter (authors, affiliations, etc.) and Quarto options,
  - the article body, written using special Quarto markdown syntax that allows you to add things like cross references and citations, and
  - optionally, code, where you control if, or how, the code and its output appear in the article.

## Project Files

- `_quarto.yml`: a configuration file that identifies the project as a Quarto manuscript and controls how your manuscript is put together.

. . .

```
project:
  type: manuscript

execute:
  freeze: auto

format:
  html:
    toc: true
    comments:
      hypothesis: true
  docx: default
  jats: default
  nature-pdf:
    journal: "sn-nature"
    keep_tex: true
```


## index.qmd

The file `index.qmd` is a Quarto markdown file. It contains three types of content:

- Starts with a YAML header, used to set document metadata, including scholarly front matter. The YAML header starts and ends with a line of three dashes (`---`)

## index.qmd

abstract: |
  In September 2021, a significant jump in seismic activity on the island of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) signaled the start of a volcanic crisis that still continues at the time of writing. Earthquake data is continually collected and published by the Instituto Geográphico Nacional (IGN). We have created an accessible dataset from this and completed preliminary data analysis which shows seismicity originating at two distinct depths, consistent with the model of a two reservoir system feeding the currently very active volcano.

```

## index.qmd

- `index.qmd` body may include executable code chunks: start with three backticks followed by the code language in curly braces (e.g. `` ```{r} `` or `` ```{python} ``). 

- The rest of the document interpreted as Quarto specific markdown, allowing you to include figures, tables, equations, cross references and citations.

## figures

`![An elephant](/path/to/elephant.png){fig-elephant}`

- Can be cross referenced with `@fig-elephant` in the document

. . .

![An elephant](img/elephant.png){width="400" fig-align="left"}


## figures

- Can also be created using `R` or `Python`

. . .

~~~
```python
#| label: fig-plot
#| fig-cap: "Plot"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
plt.show()
```
For example, see @fig-plot.
~~~


![](img/python.png){width="600" fig-align="left"}

## figures

- Can also embed from a `.qmd` or `.ipynb` file: <br>
`{{< embed mycode.ipynb#fig-plot >}}`

- Which itself contains something like: 

. . .

~~~
#| label: fig-plot
#| fig-cap: "Plot"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,23,2,4])
plt.show()
~~~

## tables

- This is probably the most complex element of Quarto

- Easiest way is using markdown pipes (using RStudio Visual mode):

. . . 

```
| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

: Demonstration of pipe table syntax {#tbl-numbers}
```

. . .

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

## tables

- You can also write your table in `R` or `Python`

. . .

~~~
```{python}
#| label: tbl-planets
#| tbl-cap: Astronomical object

from IPython.display import Markdown
from tabulate import tabulate
table = [["Sun","696,000",1.989e30],
         ["Earth","6,371",5.972e24],
         ["Moon","1,737",7.34e22],
         ["Mars","3,390",6.39e23]]
Markdown(tabulate(
  table, 
  headers=["Astronomical object","R (km)", "mass (kg)"]
))
~~~

. . .

![](img/table.png){width="800" fig-align="left"}

## tables

- Can also write tables in $\LaTeX{}$ (but may not be converted to HTML well, and vice versa)

. . . 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

![](img/latextable.png){width="200%"}
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

![](img/latextablerendered.png)
:::
:::

## references

- References can be accomplished using a `.bib` file

- Here is an example:

. . .

~~~
@article{ahmedDiamagneticComponentMap2023a,
  title = {The Diamagnetic Component Map from Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping ({{QSM}}) Source Separation Reveals Pathological Alteration in {{Alzheimer}}'s Disease-Driven Neurodegeneration},
  author = {Ahmed, Maruf and Chen, Jingjia and Arani, Arvin and Senjem, Matthew L. and Cogswell, Petrice M. and Jack, Clifford R. and Liu, Chunlei},
  year = {2023},
  month = oct,
  journal = {NeuroImage},
  volume = {280},
  pages = {120357},
  issn = {1095-9572},
  doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120357},
  langid = {english},
  pmid = {37661080},
  keywords = {Alzheimer Disease,Alzheimer's disease,Brain,Cerebral Cortex,DECOMPOSE,Demyelination,Disease Progression,Gray Matter,Humans,Magnetic susceptibility,Neurodegeneration,Quantitative susceptibility mapping}
}
~~~

- referenced in the document with `@ahmedDiamagneticComponentMap2023a`

## in-line code

- You can also mix text with in-line code, in order to reference variables

- For example:

# Simple Demonstration with Quarto

## Let's write a manuscript

- First, install quarto <https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html>

- Approach 1: Start from scratch
  - Creating a Quarto manuscript
    - RStudio: New Project > New Directory > Quarto Manuscript
    - `quarto create project manuscript <name>`
  - Add manuscript content
- Approach 2: Start with a sample from <https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts>

## Let's write a manuscript

- We will then need to decide what tool we will use:
![](img/editors.png)

- Today I will use RStudio as an example

## Let's write a manuscript

- Clone the Template Repository
  - Head to <https://github.com/quarto-ext/manuscript-template-rstudio/generate>
![](img/github_repo.png)

## Let's write a manuscript

- Once your repository is created, clone it to your local computer.
- In RStudio, you can do: **File** > **New Project**. 
- In the **New Project** dialog, select **From Version Control**, then **Git**, and copy and paste the repo URL from GitHub.
![](img/rstudio_git_manuscript.png)

## Workflow

- The basic workflow for writing a manuscript in Quarto is to make changes to your article content in `index.qmd`, preview the changes with Quarto, and repeat.

- Render and preview the manuscript by hitting the **Render** button located in the menu bar of the editor (RStudio in this case):
![](img/renderbutton.png)

## Let's write a manuscript

You’ll see some output from Quarto in the Background Jobs pane and then a live preview will appear in the Viewer pane.

![](img/quartopreview.png)

## Let's write a manuscript

What does **Render** do?

![](img/quarto_howitworks.png)

- **knitr** executes the code chunks and creates a new markdown (`.md`) document, which includes the code and its output

- the `.md` file is then processed by **pandoc**, which translates markdown/HTML/$\LaTeX{}$ into various output formats

## Let's write a manuscript

Open RStudio

[https://github.com/quarto-ext/manuscript-template-rstudio/generate](https://github.com/quarto-ext/manuscript-template-rstudio/generate)

# Real life demonstration

## Open RStudio

# What's Next?

## Collaborating

- Most people will be happy to use the `.docx` and track changes

- Others may wish to publish their page on Github and use the annotation tool
![](img/annotate.png)

## Collaborating

- Brave souls may wish to make changes to the `.tex` file and track changes with `latexdiff`
![](img/latexdiff.png)

## Publishing

- Journal will usually want the file in `.docx`, sometimes they accept `.tex`, and rarely they will take `.pdf` for reviewing and then require the `.docx` or `.tex` file once accepted

- But `.pdf`s are static... how will people be able to see your source code once your paper is published?

- Publish your HTML manuscript on Github (or other alternatives) and cite your page in your pdf, perhaps in the **Data Availability** section

- Can add a **binder** using `quarto use binder` and including `code-links: binder` in your `_quarto.yml` file

## Publishing

- [Neurolibre](https://neurolibre.org/)

- [Notebooks Now!](https://data.agu.org/notebooks-now/)

- [eLife example](https://elifesciences.org/articles/52258/executable)


# Criticisms

## What are some barriers?

- Conversion to different outputs (`.docx` `.html` `.pdf`) is not always straightforward
- Getting complex tables to work in HTML and $\LaTeX{}$
- Steep learning curve
- No career incentive to try this new approach (i.e. "who has the time?")
- Slow to preview/render (although you can set `execute: freeze: auto` so that computational documents are only re-rendered if their source file has changed)
- Errors/bugs can be frustrating (this is where a good text editor can be incredibly handy)

## What are some criticisms?

- "But people will take my analysis, run it another way, and say my results aren't valid"
- "This looks hard, I don't want to have to learn *another* new thing"
